# MINI FOOD ORDER APP 

This project is a mini food order application built with React using the useContext and useReducer hooks. Dummy data is used for food items, which are fetched from Firebase. Users can add food items to their shopping basket by clicking on the "Add" button. They can add multiple quantities of each item, and the total amount in the basket is calculated accordingly.
